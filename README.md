# Party Legacy Patcher Wii

This patcher is a user-friendly tool designed to simplify the process of patching your Just Dance games on Wii to let you access the **Party Legacy** services. 

## What files can I patch?
- [X] ISO
- [X] WBFS
- [X] DOL `(main.dol)`
- [ ] NKIT / GCZ
  - NKIT files aren't currently supported. You can convert your NKIT files to ISO by using [NKIT tools by Vimm](https://vimm.net/vault/?p=nkit).

## Usage

There are two different ways you can use this patcher:

### 1. Running with Node.JS

To run PatcherWii with Node.JS, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.JS version 16 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone the PatcherWii repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/nicolaspls/patcher-wii-main.git && cd patcher-wii-main`
3. Install the necessary dependencies with the command: `npm i`
4. Once the installation is complete, you can run the tool and view the available CLI options by executing `node index.js`.
5. To patch a bundle directly, use the following command: `node index.js path/to/wbfs/iso/or/dol`.
   For example: `node index.js C:/Users/Example/Desktop/JD2016.iso`
6. PatcherWii will automatically patch your ISO file and save it as a new file. If you're patching DOL files, it will create a backup for it.

### 2. Building from Source

If you prefer to build PatcherWii from source, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.JS version 16 or higher installed on your system.
2. Install the "pkg" package globally using the command: `npm i -g pkg`.
3. Clone the Patcher repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/nicolaspls/patcher-wii-main.git && cd patcher-wii-main`.
4. Install the necessary dependencies with the command: `npm i`.
5. Build the tool using the command: `pkg .`.
6. Once the build process is complete, you can find the built packages in the `dist/` directory.

With these simple instructions, you can easily patch your main.dol files and replace the original servers with Galaxy-Legacy servers using Patcher. Enjoy the enhanced experience!

### Where can I find WBFS or ISO of Just Dance games?
We cannot provide such information, you need to dump your legally owned game from your homebrewed Wii to WBFS or ISO format.

### What is a DOL file and where can I find it?

A DOL file, contains the source code of a game. Our tool patches this file to replace the old server URLs with our own, establishing a connection between you and the servers.

To obtain the DOL file, you can extract it by dumping the files from your **legally** owned game via tools such as **WiiBackupFusion**. Look for the DOL file in the `DATA/sys` folder. If you're using Dolphin emulator, you need to dump the entire disc starting from the root directory.
